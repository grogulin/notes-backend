# NotesApp Backend

## You can see the frontend [here](https://freedevdom.mooo.com/notes)

# Project overview:
The main idea is to create a note service in it's simplest form. In this project I am trying to develop my fullstack skills

# Service overview:
This is backend service written in ExpressJS that allows user to make basic interactions (login/logout) and manage (Create/Read/Update/Delete) their notes. Backend interacts with a PostgreSQL database which was already present on my target server so it's not included here
